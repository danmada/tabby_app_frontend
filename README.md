# Tabby

Hello! Welcome to my final project at Flatiron School, Software Engineering Program. This web app is called Tabby and allows users to locate bars and virtually open and close bar tabs. There are two unique user experiences, one for the customer and one for the business. Businesses will be able to see the tabs that have been open by customers, add and delete menu itmes, and close out tabs if needed.

Check out a demo of this project below!
